# Powershell CLI Challenge

I have completed the following powershell challenge to consolidate my knowledge of fundamentals of Powershell.

## Challenge: Trial of might

Developed by [UnderTheWire](https://underthewire.tech/) (_very similar to OverTheWire_), the exercise comprises series of exercises called _Century_ aimed at testing the fundamentals of Powershell know-hows.

## Getting started
Go to the webpage of the [Century game](https://underthewire.tech/century) and follow the instructions there. **Complete a maximum amount of levels** and **take note of the passwords** for each one of them

## Solution
Upon completion of the challenge, I have encrypted the passwords for each level with GPG encryption in the solution file, as well as my public key: 

**Solution file**: [Challenge passwords](password_TOM.txt.asc) <br>
**Public key file**: [Public key](publik_key.txt)

_NB: The encrypted file can only be accessed by the Coach whose public key was used for the encryption._
